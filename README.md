## 🧪 Test Drive (Remote Demo)

🚀 Don’t have a Ryzen™ AI PC? Instantly try FastFlowLM on a live AMD Ryzen™ AI 5 340 NPU with 32 GB memory ([spec](https://www.amazon.com/4X4-BOX-AI340-Display-Support-Copilot/dp/B0F2GFLF67/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1X16RDUCQ2497&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.C5GS4xMl_kkJ7Yr6dNFi6g.Dfj_l9Dk1yuIBjppqmKSqNAAPQc1F4Mu3zJ9-MDlszw&dib_tag=se&keywords=4x4+box+ai340&qid=1752010554&sprefix=www.amazon.com%2F4X4-BOX-AI340%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-5)) — no setup needed.  

✨ Now with **Gemma3:4b (the first NPU-only VLM!)** supported here.  

🌐 **Launch Now**: [https://open-webui.testdrive-fastflowlm.com/](https://open-webui.testdrive-fastflowlm.com/)  
🔐 **Login**: `guest@flm.npu`  
🔑 **Password**: `0000`

📺 [**Watch this short video**](https://youtu.be/0AhkX2ZLu7Y?list=PLf87s9UUZrJqcaO6Vrl4YAmkofdGkvlom) to see how to try the remote demo in just a few clicks.

> Alternatively, **sign up** with your own credentials instead of using the shared guest account.
> ⚠️ Some universities or companies may **block access** to the test drive site. If it doesn't load over Wi-Fi, try switching to a **cellular network**.  
> Real-time demo powered by **FastFlowLM + Open WebUI** — no downloads, no installs.  
> Try optimized LLM models: `gemma3:4b`, `qwen3:4b`, etc. — all accelerated on NPU.

⚠️ **Please note**:  
- FastFlowLM is designed for **single-user local use**. This remote demo machine may experience short wait times when **multiple users** access it concurrently — please be patient.
- When switching models, it may take longer time to replace the model in memory.
- Large prompts (30k+ tokens) and VLM (gemma3:4b) may take longer — but it works! 🙂

## ⚡ Quick Start

A packaged Windows installer is available here: [**flm-setup.exe**](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM/releases/latest/download/flm-setup.exe). For more details, see the [release notes](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM/releases/).

📺 [**Watch the quick start video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYOfDNkyBII)

> ⚠️ Ensure NPU driver is **32.0.203.258** or later (check via Task Manager→Performance→NPU or Device Manager) — [Driver Download](https://www.amd.com/en/support).

After installation, open **PowerShell**. To run a model in terminal (CLI Mode):
```
flm run llama3.2:1b
```
> Requires internet access to HuggingFace to pull (download) the optimized model kernel. The model will be downloaded to the folder: ``C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\flm\models\``. ⚠️ If HuggingFace is not directly accessible in your region, you can manually download the model and place it in this directory.

To start the local server (Server Mode):
```
flm serve llama3.2:1b
```
> The model tag (e.g., `llama3.2:1b`) sets the initial model, which is optional. If another model is requested, FastFlowLM will automatically switch to it. Local server is on port 11434 (default).

By default, **FLM runs in `performance` NPU power mode**. You can switch to other NPU power modes (`powersaver`, `balanced`, or `turbo`) using the `--pmode` flag:

**CLI mode:**
```Powershell
flm run gemma3:4b --pmode balanced
```

**Server mode:**
```Powershell
flm serve gemma3:4b --pmode balanced
```

> ⚠️ Note: Using powersaver or balanced will lower NPU clock speeds and cause a significant drop in speed. For more details about NPU power mode, refer to the [AMD XRT SMI Documentation](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/xrt_smi.html).

For detailed instructions, click [Documentation](https://docs.fastflowlm.com/).

## 🖼️ Vision Support 

FastFlowLM now supports **vision-language inference** (e.g., **Gemma3:4b**). ⚡ Quick start:  

After installation, open **PowerShell** and run:
```
flm run gemma3:4b
```

In CLI, attach an image:
```
/input "path/to/image.png" What's in this image?
```

> Supports **.png** and **.jpg** formats
