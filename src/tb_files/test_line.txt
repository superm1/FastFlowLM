Teach me Maxwell’s Equations in a clear, comprehensive, and structured way—about 5000 words long. Begin with the historical context, including the experimental discoveries and figures like Faraday and Maxwell that led to their development. Present all four equations in both integral and differential forms, with full explanations of each symbol and physical quantity. Explain the physical meaning and intuition behind each law, using analogies or visual concepts where helpful (e.g., divergence, curl, flux). Discuss how these equations unify electricity, magnetism, and optics, and derive the electromagnetic wave equation, including how they predict the speed of light. Explore real-world applications such as in radio, wireless communication, MRI, and radar. Finally, place Maxwell’s Equations in a modern theoretical context, including their role in relativity and quantum electrodynamics. Write with a tone that’s educational and accessible for a university-level science audience, while being detailed, logically organized, and engaging.
