> **Features:**
> - Alternatively, **sign up** with your own credentials instead of using the shared guest account.
> - ⚠️ Some universities or companies may **block access** to the test drive site. If it doesn't load over Wi-Fi, try switching to a **cellular network**.  
> - Real-time demo powered by **FastFlowLM + Open WebUI** — no downloads, no installs.

> ⚠️ **Please note**:  
> - FastFlowLM is designed for **single-user local use**. This remote demo machine may experience short wait times when **multiple users** access it concurrently — please be patient.
> - When switching models, it may take longer time to replace the model in memory.
> - Large prompts and VLM (gemma3:4b) may take longer — but it works! 🙂
