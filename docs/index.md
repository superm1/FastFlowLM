# ⚡ FastFlowLM (FLM)

**FLM** is the only **NPU-first runtime** built for AMD Ryzen™ AI.  

Run **LLMs — now with Vision support — in minutes**: **no GPU required**, **over 10× more power-efficient**, and with **context lengths up to 256k tokens**.  

Think **Ollama — but laser-optimized for NPUs**.  

From *idle silicon* to *instant power* — **FastFlowLM makes Ryzen™ AI shine.**

📺 [Watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AhkX2ZLu7Y&list=PLf87s9UUZrJp4r3JM4NliPEsYuJNNqFAJ&index=2) to see how to try the remote demo in just a few clicks.

> ⚠️ **Please note**:
> - Some universities or companies may **block access** to the test drive site. If it doesn't load over Wi-Fi, try switching to a **cellular network**.  
> - FastFlowLM is designed for **single-user local use**. This remote demo machine may experience short wait times when **multiple users** access it concurrently — please be patient.
> - When switching models, it may take longer time to replace the model in memory.
> - Large prompts and VLM (gemma3:4b) may take longer — but it works! 🙂
