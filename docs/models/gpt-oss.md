```

Default resoning effort for both CLI and Server Modes is Medium

Set reasoning effort (CLI):

```

> 📝 NOTE

> - **Memory Requirements**  
   ⚠️ **Note**: Running `gpt-oss:20b` may need a system with **> 32 GB RAM**. The model itself uses ~15.1 GB of memory in FLM, and there is an internal cap (~15.6 GB) from on NPU memory allocation enforced by AMD/Microsoft, which makes only about half of the total system RAM available to the NPU. **On 32 GB machines, it sometimes works sometimes not**, so we recommend more RAM for a smooth experience.
