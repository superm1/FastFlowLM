      FastFlowLM is a collaboration between academic researchers, software engineers,
      and community maintainers. The core group includes four PhDs and three
      B.S. graduates in Electrical and Computer Engineering with deep experience in LLM internals, parallel
      processing, and architecture-specific software optimization.
